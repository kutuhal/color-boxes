# color-boxes

###What it does?
It creates a block with colorful boxes which changes as mouse moves over it.

This was created to crystalize JavaScript learning on:
* Generate random number & use it to generate random color
* Events like onmouseover and onload

And also to reinforce the basic knowledge of CSS.
